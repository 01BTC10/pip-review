# How to contribute to `pip-review`

First rule: please **do** contribute!

I (@jgonggrijp) want to keep `pip-review` in the air, but I cannot dedicate much time to maintaining it. So if you see a way to improve `pip-review`, whether by fixing a bug or by adding a feature, please go ahead and submit a pull request.

## Suggestions

Any kind of contribution is welcome; nothing is "off limits". However, for those who would like some guidance:

  - Look for issues with the [help wanted](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/help%20wanted), [question](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/question) or [poll](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review/labels/poll) label. In the latter case, if you have an opinion, vote by adding an emoticon of your choice to the opening post. Feel free to explain your vote in a response or to thumbs-up another response that explains your opinion.
  - Issues that are associated with a milestone are ordered by relative priority. To see the priority order, click on the milestone. Needless to say, the highest priority issue is at the top.

## The fine print

This repo ([jgonggrijp/pip-review](https://github.com/jgonggrijp/pip-review)) uses [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow). Please submit pull requests to the `develop` branch.

The Python files use 4-space soft tabs. The other files use 2-space soft tabs.
